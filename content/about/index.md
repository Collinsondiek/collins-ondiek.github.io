Hello! I'm Gaurav Raj. Hacker, Programmer & FreeLancer. from Bihar, India.

A CyberSecurity Student, constantly learning new things while making and breaking things and playing around.

I have completed the **TechHacker \[EHCS\]** by [bittentech](https://bittentechsolutions.in) and **eJPT** from [ELearnSecurity](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/)

I also sometimes write tech blogs, walkthroughs and writeups on my [blog](https://gauravraj.tech/) and create vulnerable machines or VMs on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/thehackersbrain,789/), hope to do more in future, who knows :)

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
